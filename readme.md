# Cross GCC Builder

The Cross GCC Builder project is the

- concept and
- development

of a GCC compilation helper with aim of allowing easy copy and compilation of

- includes,
- executables and
- other requirements

for various platforms, allowing that the download of "CrossGCC" download (and its makefile execution) and the official GCC (any version, https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git) repositories files are sufficient for the creation of compiler executables (and dependencies for usage) for the targeted platform such that compiles for other destination platforms.

For example, with CrossGCC, you can build the full GNU compiler collection from Linux to Windows and new executables can create for Win32, Win64, Android, MIPS, etc, developing from windows to a lot of platforms with just editor and terminal, no more required sources, programs, scripts...

#### Collaboration

The project is open to volunteers until I become satisfied (all current possible platforms, best working and great settings, doesn't need so much), then it becomes read-only.

#### How to do it?

The initial plan may change, but the building of this minimal development environment occurs with

- downloading CrossGcc into the "DIR" directory (e.g. "DIR=C:/Program Files" and the CrossGcc folder is created there),
- downloading GCC in the "DIR/CrossGcc" directory (creating the folder there with the default name of the official repository),
- execution of the makefile in "DIR/CrossGcc" which will compile and run the Cross GCC Builder and
- configuration via terminal as Cross GCC Builder will print questions such as GCC directory, GCC target platform and executable targets generated by GCC

and then uses the GCC files in the source directory to generate the results (ready to compile something) in the configured directory, including a folder with the GCC executables for the chosen multiple platforms.
